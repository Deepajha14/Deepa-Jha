          <h3>Hey there, 👋</h3>
          I'm <span> Deepa </span>, a final year student pursuing <span>B.Tech in CSE </span> from New Delhi, India. I build websites with a focus on responsiveness, accessibility and pleasing aesthetics. Being well versed in all the key languages allows me to rapidly design, code and deploy in an organized and efficient manner. While I specialize in <span>frontend development,</span> I'm also delving into <span>backend technologies.</span> I'm all ears for <span>new opportunities</span> to create awesome software solutions. Let's team up and cook up some digital wonders together.
          <br/> <br/>
          Beyond coding, <span>I'm an artist at heart❤️</span> – you'll often find me lost in the world of sketches and colors. I really enjoy being creative, so I like to spend my free time drawing, sketching, and painting. It's a great way for me to unwind and tap into my creative side.
